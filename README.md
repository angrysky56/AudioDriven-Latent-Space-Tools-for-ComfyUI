Librosa Audio Analysis to Noise node for ComfyUI.

This is a custom node for ComfyUI that analyzes audio files using Librosa, extracting tempo, beat times, energy levels, and timestamps. The analysis results can be displayed in a text box within ComfyUI.

Features

    Audio Duration: Shows the total length of the audio in seconds.
    Tempo: Displays the beats per minute (BPM) of the audio.
    Beat Times: Provides timestamps for each beat detected in the audio.
    Energy Levels: Displays the energy levels calculated at intervals throughout the audio.
    Energy Timestamps: Lists the corresponding timestamps for each energy level.

Settings

WARNING: TIMESTAMP NOISE GENERATOR NODE 
    
    Typical frame counts: Average measurements by analysis type (from 3s, 11.65s, and 89s samples)

    Default: huge (~122K for 89s)
    
    Mel/spectral/tempo: high (~7.6K for 89s)

    Onset: moderate (60-500 depending on complexity) 

    Beat: low (14-168 based on tempo) 

    Second: consistent (~length in seconds) 

    Half_second: consistent (~2x seconds) 


Choose analysis type based on desired frame count and use case.
Supported types: Default, onset, segment, tempo, Mel, spectral, second, half_second, beat.

Noise types: Gaussian, salt and pepper, Perlin.
